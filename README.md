# Coffee-Machine
Programming a coffee machine simulator. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.
Stage 1/6: Hello, coffee!
  Writing a program that puts basic information on the screen: give the machine a chance to tell the customers what it’s doing!
Stage 2/6: Machines have needs.
  Programing the machine to calculate the amount of ingredients it needs depending on how many people want some coffee.
Stage 3/6: Enough coffee for everyone.
  Working with conditions, programing the machine to estimate how many creamy coffees it can make based on the amount of ingredients entered.
Stage 4/6: Action!
  Upgrading knowledge of methods - setting the machine to perform three basic actions: collect the money, renew the supplies, and serve the coffee.
Stage 5/6: On a coffee loop.
  Programing the machine to display on the screen the amount of supplies left. Setting the main loop: now the menu keeps updating until you enter “exit”.
Stage 6/6: Brush up the code.
  Time for some final touch-ups: structuring the code so that it runs smoothly.
